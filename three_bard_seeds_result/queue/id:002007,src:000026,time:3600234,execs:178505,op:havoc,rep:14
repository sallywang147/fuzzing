	<!-- Version 1.3
	Tf the XML-format kanji file combining information from
	the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files. It is intended to be largely self-
	documenting, with each field being accompanied by an explanatory
	comment.

	The file covers the following kanji:
	(a) the 6,355 kanji from JIS X 0208;
	(b) the 5,801 kanji from JIS X 0212;
	(c) the 3,625 kanji from JIS X 0213 as follows:
		(i) the 2,741 kanji which are also in JIS X 0212 have
		JIS X 0213 code-points (kuten) added to the existing entry;
		(ii) the 884 "new" kanji have new entries.

	At the end of the explanation for a number of fields there is a tag
	with the format [N]. This indicates the leading letter(s) of the
	equivalent field in the KANJIDIC and KANJD212 files.

	The KANJIDIC documentation should also be read for additional 
	information about the information in the file.
